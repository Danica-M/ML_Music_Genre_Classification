###
This research project focuses on developing an automated music genre classification system using the GTZAN Music Genre Dataset. Two machine learning models, the Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) and K-nearest neighbours (KNN), are used for this music genre classification. 
In addition to these models, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model were also implemented for comparison purposes.

<h3 align="center">GTZAN Dataset:</h3>
In this music genre classification project, we will utilise the GTZAN dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains 1000 audio files, each 30 seconds long, belonging to 10 different genre classes, with each class consisting of 100 tracks. The audio files are in .wav format and the ten (10) genres are Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, Blues, Classical and Rock.
